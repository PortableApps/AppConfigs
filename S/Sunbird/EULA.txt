Please note that Sunbird is no longer maintained by Mozilla and should not be used in a production or day-to-day environment.  PortableApps.com is making this final release available as a convenience to existing users and for testing purposes.

Users should transition to using Thunderbird with the Lightning extension for their calendar needs.  A guide on migrating is available here:
