1. CREDIT. Every Mosaic (or derivative work) created and published (or distributed in any way) must include a credit text to AndreaMosaic. The credit text should state "Mosaic created with AndreaMosaic" or a text with a similar meaning and it can be written in the language of the target audience. The credit text is not required to interfere with the mosaic artwork but who sees the mosaic should be able to find out that AndreaMosaic software was used to create it. All other aspects of the credit text (e.g., size, style, duration, location, etc.) are at the sole discretion of the publisher but must comply with above requirement. Any of the following examples comply with this requirement and also other similar examples are accepted:
* In a Mosaic Image published on the Web a small text somewhere with a hyper-link to AndreaMosaics web page.
* In a Mosaic printed and published on a wall a small credit text can be placed on a informative note to be placed near the mosaic. The informative note can contain other text too.
* In a Movie / TV Show / Web Video the credit text can be placed in the end credits of the Movie / Episode / Web Video. 
* In a Mosaic published on any media (including web, printing, broadcasting, TV, etc) the credit text can be included in the informative details published together with the mosaic.
