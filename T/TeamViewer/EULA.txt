4. Server Services and other services provided by TeamViewer



4.1. 
 
Server Services. For the establishment of encrypted remote communication connections between different users of the Software, the Software must respectively first of all communicate with servers of TeamViewer (so-called “handshake”). In addition, it may be necessary for the transmission of data in the context of a session (e.g. online meeting or remote maintenance) that encrypted data packets be forwarded by servers of TeamViewer (so-called “routing”). Such handshake and routing are made available in connection with TeamViewer’s Server Services. 
 
 

(i) 
 
Subject matter. TeamViewer is willing to provide Customer with the respective Server Services. The Server Services may be unavailable from time to time due to technical difficulties or due to causes beyond the reasonable control of TeamViewer. The Internet connection between the Customer and the data center as well as the required hardware and software (e.g. PC, operating system) shall not be included in the services provided by TeamViewer and shall be Customer’s responsibility. The respective costs shall be borne by Customer.
 

(ii) 
 
Term. In case of a subscription term license, the Server Services may be provided during the limited term of the Customer’s subscription to the Software. In the event of free licenses (“Freemium Software”) TeamViewer may in its sole discretion discontinue or modify the Server Services at any time.
 
 

4.2. 
 
Installation, configuration. The Customer shall be solely responsible for the installation and configuration of the Software. TeamViewer is not responsible for any installation or configuration.
 

4.3.

4.4. 
 
Documentation. TeamViewer shall provide a PDF manual retrievable online in German and English. Any further languages may be offered by TeamViewer on a voluntary basis, at TeamViewer’s sole discretion. The documentation is available under link.

4.5. 
 
Minor updates. TeamViewer may, at its sole discretion, elect to provide Customer with free minor updates of the Software for download. Minor updates may be marked by TeamViewer - in its sole discretion - by a change in the number behind the main version number (e.g. version XX.1, XX.2). Minor updates may include the correction of errors as well as minor improvements of functions (e.g. optimizations in the program execution speed). TeamViewer shall have no obligation to provide minor updates to Customer; provided, however, that if TeamViewer does elect to provide minor updates to Customer then the Customer shall be obligated to integrate the current update of the Software at its own cost into the then current version of the Software in use by Customer. This shall not affect any warranty claims of the Customer. All rights of use set forth herein that are applicable to the Software shall also apply to all minor updates.
 

4.6. 
 
Major updates. Major updates of the Software are new versions of the Software, usually comprising more extensive modifications of the functions. Major updates may be marked by TeamViewer - in its sole discretion - by a change of the main version number (e.g. version XX, YY). TeamViewer shall not be obligated to provide any major updates to Customer. In the event that TeamViewer elects to provide any major updates to Customer, TeamViewer may require the Customer to pay an additional fee for use of such major updates to the extent Customer elects to license such major update. 
 

4.7. 
 
Programming interfaces. At TeamViewer’s discretion, the Software or Server Services may provide programming interfaces or other software interfaces (“API”) which may include applications of third parties or of the Customer (“Third-party Software”) that can communicate with the Software or respectively the servers of TeamViewer. TeamViewer may change or switch off APIs at any time without any obligation or liability to Customer. The respective provider shall be responsible for the Third-party Software. The provisions of this Contract shall not apply to any such Third-party Software and TeamViewer shall have no liability for any Third-party Software.
 

4.8. 
 
Telephone conference number. If, in the context of its services, TeamViewer provides a telephone conference number for dialing in as an alternative to the audio conference function of the Software, the provider of the respective telecommunication service (and not TeamViewer) shall be the owner of the telephone connection of the respective number. The use of the telephone conference number shall be subject to a separate fee and is not included in the user fee pursuant to this Contract. If applicable, the invoicing shall be performed by the telephone provider of the participant.
 

4.9. 
 
Changes to the services. TeamViewer may change the Software in the context of updates as well as the Server Services (including the system requirements) for good cause. Such a good cause shall exist especially if the change is required due to (i) a necessary adaptation required by applicable law, (ii) changed technical framework conditions (new encryption standards), or (iii) the protection of the system security.

Any further liability of TeamViewer shall be excluded irrespective of the legal basis, unless TeamViewer is mandatorily liable in accordance with the law, in particular due to injury to life, body or health of an individual, due to the provision of an express warranty, fraudulent concealment of a defect or due to the provisions of the German Product Liability Act. 
 

7.2.

Subject matter. TeamViewer is willing to provide Customer with the Server Services. The Server Services may be unavailable from time to time due to technical difficulties or due to causes beyond the reasonable control of TeamViewer.

The respective costs shall be borne by the Customer.
 

(ii)

Minor updates may include the correction of errors as well as minor improvements of functions (e.g. optimizations in the program execution speed). TeamViewer shall have no obligation to provide minor updates to Customer; provided, however, that if TeamViewer does elect to provide minor updates to Customer then the Customer shall be obligated to integrate the current update of the Software at its own cost into the then current version of the Software in use by Customer. All rights of use set forth herein that are applicable to the Software shall also apply to all minor updates.

Termination notice. The termination must be made in writing (signed letter, telefax) or in text form (e.g. email).
